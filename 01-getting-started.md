# 🛠️ 01 - Getting Started with Git

## 🧩 What Even Is Git?

Git is a version control system. That means:
- I can track code history
- I can go back to old versions if I mess up
- I don’t lose code by saving over it

## 🔧 Installing Git

1. Download: https://git-scm.com
2. After install:
```bash
git --version
